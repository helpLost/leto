# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
Fortunately, Leto is still a bit too far in alpha to have any sort of security versioning. This section will be updated, however, when the need arises.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
I take user security very seriously. Therefore, if you find a vulernability, PLEASE REPORT IT TO ME VIA EMAIL. A ticket on GitHub about security issues will be immediately closed and deleted, as making more people aware of these vulerabilities has the chance to do far more harm than good.
